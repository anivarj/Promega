# Promega

Hello! If you've reached this repo, you've found my scripts for Promega (Target Engagement). This README is written for first-time code runners, so if you're already familiar with GitHub, please feel free to skip the irrelevant portions.

To run my code, you will need Python3, a few different packages, and an easy way to execute the code. There are many ways you can do this, but I have found that the easiest one for first-timers is to use Anaconda (which downloads python and all the other goodies), and Visual Studio Code (a fancy text editor where you can run the scripts). 

I've written a short tutorial document on how to get set up, but please note that this is for Windows machines, so the VSCode portion will be a little different on Mac and Linux.

## Software needed ##

1.	Download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to get python3 and required packages
2.	Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to open and run scripts
3.	Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (optional) if you want to get the latest and greatest updates to my scripts. 

## Set up VSCode (first time only) ##
1.	Open the program.
2. Navigate to `Extensions` (the four block icon on the left-hand side of the window)
3. Search for and install the `Python` package

5.	Navigate to `File -> Preferences -> Settings` 
6.	In the preferences, search for `“Terminal Integrated Default Profile: Windows”`
7.	Select `“Command Prompt”`. This tells the program which shell to use when running scripts.

7.	Navigate to `View -> Command Palette`. 
8.	Search for `“Python Select Interpreter”`.
9.	Choose the Python version that has `('base')` next to it (it should be `Python 3.9.XX`). This tells the program where your python lives so it can call it to run things.

## Download my scripts ##
You have two major options for accessing my materials. 
1.  You can download a static "copy" file to your local computer
2.  You can clone and sync the entire repository to your computer using GitHub Desktop (this way, any changes I make will be pushed to you).

First-time users or those who don't need the latest and greatest will likely be fine just downloading a static copy, however if you would like to stay up-to-date, let me know if you'd like help setting things up with GitHub Desktop (link above)! :)  

To download a static copy, click on the green "Code" button and download the ZIP file.
Open the ZIP file and move the folder to wherever you want on your computer (mine are in `Documents`).

## Run the scripts ##
1.  Open Visual Studio Code
2.  Open the location of the scripts folder and select the script you want to run (should end with `.py`).
3.  In the top right-hand corner of the window, click on the Play button to run the script.

![VSCode Run Button](https://github.com/anivarj/Promega/blob/main/VsCode-Run.png)

4.	In the pop-up window, navigate to where your data is stored and click `select folder`.
5.	The script will now automatically run. Any errors or messages will pop up in the terminal at the bottom of the VSCode window.

## FAQ ##
**Help! I'm lost and/or the script is not working!**

If you find a bug or run into problems, let me know! Things that work on my machine may not necessarily operate the same for you, so it's helpful for me to know when things aren't working right. 


**I really hate < specific feature> / I really wish you had < specific feature >**

If there’s a feature you hate or wish to see, also let me know! I'm by no means an expert, but I enjoy learning and trying new things!
